              <p>On the intersection of Delancey Street and Essex Street, you find yourself in a foreign, yet familiar environment.</p>
              <p>The street tiles are the classic gray squares with black dots covering the surface, a landmark left by the bubble gum that was spit onto the ground years ago. The sound of cars and people fills the atmosphere and the smell of pollution, food, and cigarettes occasionally fill your lungs. Most people that travel through this area to get to work or school tend to overlook the things that make this place what it is. But defining this place is a lot harder than it seems because you can’t put a label on it that represents everybody.</p>
              <p>On the southeast corner, you see Essex Market, Regal, and other modern and fancy outlets. It’s objectively better maintained than its northern counterpart. Where Regal and Essex Market have luxuriously tinted glass panels and vibrant interiors, the northern side consists of neglected buildings with graffiti painted all over them. The ‘New’ Roma Pizza and Beer & Smoke shop have been permanently closed for a long time. The old essex market can still be seen - it too has been abandoned and vandalized, unlike the new one that was built a block away. There was a shop there that was once a metropcs store, but you’d never know unless you looked at old photos or videos. The purple awning had been ripped apart in the middle, leaving a hole where the name and logo of the store once were, and the steel gates that protect the interior have remained pulled down for a long time.</p>
              <p>The shops that are still open haven’t been spared either. The Burger King a block down looked abandoned for quite a long time, yet it was somehow still open.</p>
              <p>This isn’t a secluded or homogeneous place. Delancey and Essex bring in all people from new york. some are better off than others, while others are barely getting by. You can see that in the people that come here. Businessmen walk by swiftly with one hand holding a phone to their ear and the other holding a cup of coffee. Students laugh along with their friends as they walk slowly to school. Men and women working a nine-to-five job walk with their heads down, bracing themselves for another day of work. Homeless men ask you to spare some change and police officers that look worn out check if cars have paid the meters. This place encompasses all people despite the differences in economic and social status or if Delancey and Essex looks reputable or forsaken.</p>
              <p>Below this world lies another realm which is our subway station. The staircase down is an unpleasant one, to say the least. It’s dirty and discolored from all the muck that built up over the decades. Occasionally, I’d also be hit with the nose-burning smell of urine that I could never seem to pinpoint the source of. The station is old and worn down. It’s neglected, just like Canal Street’s station. It’s grimy, dull, and grosses you out the first few times, but eventually, you get used to it. Your mind adjusts to this new land and it no longer becomes foreign to you.</p>
              <p>The station connects the trains of the F, M, J, and Z lines, bringing people from Queens, Brooklyn, and Manhattan together. we have a firsthand experience of the problems that burden this city. Homeless men and women make the subway their home, pushing their carts of trashbags and personal belongings with them wherever they go. Drug users saunter about, rambling about something incomprehensible. It’s a common sight to see this at delancey. It’s not favorable, but we New Yorkers have learned to live with it.</p>
              <p>But besides all that, it’s an iconic place nonetheless. It has mosaics of fish and trees like the flower mosaics at the Bedford Park Blvd-Lehman College station. yet, as someone who regularly uses this station to take the subway, I never really noticed or cared. I forgot that at the staircase of the m line, going up from the Downtown F platform, there was a fish mosaic. Only by looking at pictures did I realize it was there. In essence, it blended in so perfectly with its surroundings or I so perfectly overlooked it. I forgot that on the Uptown F platform, there were cherry orchid mosaics. When I looked at pictures online, they seemed new, like I had never seen them before. But when I dug into my memories, I realized it was there all along. i always saw it as i got off the uptown f to go to school. I always saw it across the tracks when I was on the downtown platform to go home.</p>
              <p>It is these things that make my city what it is - a city that encompasses a polarized identity. From the prestige of what we have to offer, to the poverty that we would rather not show, these things are the very definition of New York and, for better or worse, if it lacked any one of these, it would cease to be the city that so many know. So perhaps defining Delancey and Essex is not so hard after all, because it holds a certain embodiment of New York as a whole.</p>
